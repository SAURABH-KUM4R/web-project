Node.js is a platform that utilizes JavaScript and is primarily employed for developing web applications that are highly focused on input/output operations, including but not limited to chat applications and multimedia streaming websites. The platform is constructed using Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. A web application is a type of software that executes on a server and is displayed by a client's browser that obtains all the application's resources over the internet.First of all, Node.js is a lightweight runtime. It uses an asynchronous, event-driven I/O model which ensures that almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O. This time-saving operation cuts down the time developers spend on deploying an application.Node.js offers both client-side and server-side in JavaScript. It means that applications written in Node.js require fewer files and less code as developers can reuse it for the frontend and backend parts of an application. As a result, your development team delivers faster results and you can cut down on personnel hours by hiring a team of full-stack developers â€” instead of separately bringing on a frontend and backend developer(s).
